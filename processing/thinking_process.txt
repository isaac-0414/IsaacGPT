Looking at webpage
    ->If webpage short, look at the entire webpage
        ->Able to solve the problem?
            -Yes
                ->link section
    ->Else if webpage long, split it into chunks
        1. If possible, generate a summary of the entire webpage
        2. Looking at each chunk, given the big idea of this website am I able to solve this problem? Will looking at other part of webpage also be helpful?
            -Able to solve
                ->Provide answer, add thoughts about whether other chunks will be helpful and keep going
            -Not able to solve
                ->keep going
        3. Create summary of each chunk
        4. Given summary of each chunk and my previous answer, and the big idea, am I able to solve it / get a better answer?
            -Yes
                ->self-criticize, keep going
            -No
                ->Keep going
    =>Self criticize, answer need adjustment
        -Yes
            ->Need to look back into the webpage
                ->...
